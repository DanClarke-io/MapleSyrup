# MapleSyrup

MapleSyrup is a knowledge growth tool that allows its users to rapidly absorb key information, without having to find the original source, read the surrounding text and interpret once again the key facts.

In essence it allows a user to create their own TLDR of multiple information resources allowing for easy rapid, effective recaps and absorption of those facts.

You will find MapleSyrup most useful when learning a new subject for the first time or reading a book.
